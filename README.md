# My Data Science Journey
Created this repo to document my journey to becoming a data scientist. It includes weekly progress updates, notes from my studies, and hands-on projects.

I compiled a list of credible resources (books, videos, courses) together for a self-study program over the next 18 months or so. The first 4 months is a refresh of the fundamentals. The remaining months will be spent in the MIT MicroMasters Statistics and Data Science Program.

I used GPT-4o to structure all of my "fundamentals" resources into a custom curriculum — time-bound to May 14th, when the Data Science Program begins.

Each week, I'll share my notes, projects, and resources!

Let's goo!
